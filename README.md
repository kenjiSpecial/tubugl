# tubugl
module base webgl framework for personal use

## concept

three.js is easy, fun to develop webgl.

webgl from scratch( I call it plain webgl) is pain, hard. 

it takes MUCH MORE TIME AND ERRORS to develop than three.js.

it's hard to understand how webgl works and how matrix works like camera to keep using three.js

tubugl is devloping webgl like scratch.

more pain, more gain.

you can understand how webgl wroks more deep.

you can understand what webgl is more, can understand why many people use three.js insted of plain webgl.
