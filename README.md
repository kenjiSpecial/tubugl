# tubugl
module base webgl framework for personal use

## concept

three.js is easy, fun to develop webgl.

webgl from scratch( I call it plain webgl) is pain, hard. 

it takes MUCH MORE TIME AND ERRORS to develop than three.js.

it's hard to understand how webgl works and how matrix works like camera when you keep using only three.js.

three.js is very smart, handy. you can make basic stuff even without knowledge of shader, program, and buffer.

tubugl is moduble base micro webgl framework which you can develop webgl like scratch.

You feel more pain with tubugl than three.js.

More Pain, More Gain.

you can understand how webgl wroks and how matrix works more deeply with tubugl.

you can understand what webgl is more, can understand why many people use three.js insted of plain webgl.

to be honest, I understoodnd webgl more deeply during I was developing this framework.
