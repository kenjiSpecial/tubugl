## Concept

three.js is easy, fun to develop webgl.

webgl from scratch( I call it plain webgl) is pain, hard. 

it takes MUCH MORE TIME to develop with plain webgl than with three.js.

it's hard to understand how webgl works and how matrix works like camera when you keep using only three.js.

three.js is very smart, handy. you can make basic stuff even without knowledge of shader, program, and buffer.

tubugl is moduble base micro webgl framework which you can develop webgl like scratch.

You feel more pain with tubugl than three.js.

More Pain, More Gain.

you can understand how webgl wroks and how matrix works more deeply with tubugl.

to be honest, I understoodnd webgl more deeply during I was developing tubugl modules.
